**Chauffeur** is a photorealistic driving simulation game that is being developed in Unreal Engine 5. In the game, players take on the role of a chauffeur, responsible for safely delivering clients to their destinations. Within the game, players begin as newcomers in their respective job roles, gradually advancing by joining various groups to build stronger professional connections and increase their affinity.

I use lumen lighting system and nanite technologies to build the game environment. As for the car physics, i use unreal chaos vehicles plugin to simulate the vehicle physics. The car model that is currently used in the game is Porsche 911 GT3, all of the car specs informations are imported into the game to ensure realistic driving experience.
